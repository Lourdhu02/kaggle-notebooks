This is a personal Kaggle publishing challenge, but suggestions and improvements are welcome.

## Suggesting a Notebook Topic

Open an Issue with:
- Proposed notebook title (SEO-friendly)
- Category and difficulty
- Why it would be useful to the Kaggle community

## Code Style for Notebooks

- Every notebook must have a markdown intro cell explaining what it covers
- Use section headers (H2/H3) throughout
- Explain every major code block in plain English
- End with a summary and next steps cell
- Target audience: intermediate ML practitioners
