Run `update_progress.py` before every push. It reads which notebooks have been moved to `published/` subfolders and auto-updates this README and `PROGRESS.md`.

```bash
python update_progress.py
git add .
git commit -m "[publish] computer-vision/easy/cnn-from-scratch-explained-simply"
git push origin main
```
